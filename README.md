*\_Please, for the love of all things code, don’t ever use this *ridiculous* language. The only valid reasons for using it are if every other programming language has been erased from existence, or if you’re trying to build the world’s most advanced farming simulator. Do yourself a massive favor—ditch it and let’s leave PHP in the past where it belongs!\_*

Additionally, make sure to run `composer install` to install the required packages before running the project.
